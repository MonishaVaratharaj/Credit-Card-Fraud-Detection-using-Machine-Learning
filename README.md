# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The Logistic Regression model is trained on a labeled dataset containing historical credit card transaction data, with the goal of identifying potentially fraudulent transactions.

## Project Structure

- `credit_card_fraud_detection.py`: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and fraud detection using Logistic Regression.
- `credit_card_dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the Logistic Regression model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

You can install them using pip with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
